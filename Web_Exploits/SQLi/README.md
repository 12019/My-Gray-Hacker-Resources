# SQL Injections

* A SQL query  search can be easily manipulated and assume that a SQL query search is a reliable command. This means  that SQL searches are capable of passing, unnoticed, by access control mechanisms. 
* Using methods of diverting standard authentication and by checking the authorization credentials, you can gain access to important information stored in a database. 

## Examples

* A parameter passed for a name of a user:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE
name="$name";
```

In this case, the attacker just needs to introduce a true logical expression like ```1=1```:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE 1=1;
```
So that the **WHERE** clause is always executed, which means that it will return the values that match to all users.

Nowadays it is estimated that less than 5% of the websites have this vulnerability.
