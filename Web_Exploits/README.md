## Other Resources

#### When we have a Website/IP Address:

- Try to add folders to the domain, such as http://csaw2014.website.com or http://key.website.com.

- We brute force the subdomains, for example, with [subbrute.py]. This tool performs multi-threaded DNS lookups to a configurable list of DNS resolvers, searching through a list of possible subdomains.

- Use the command ```dig``` or ```ping``` in Linux to find the IP  address of the website.

- *wgetting* the entire website with something like ```wget -e robots=off --tries=40 -r -H -l 4 <WEBSITE>```.

- Check the *robot.txt* file for hidden folders.

- Inspect the DOM using the browser's developer tools to look for HTML comments (plain view-source won't work when the content is loaded through Ajax).

## URLs

#### Octal

- Example: http://017700000001 --> 127.0.0.1

- For example 206.191.158.50:

((206 * 256 + 191) * 256 + 158 ) * 256 + 50 = 3468664370.

Now, there is a further step that can make this address even more obscure. You can add to this dword number, any multiple of the quantity 4294967296 (2564) 


#### Great @

-Everything between "http://" and "@" is completely irrelevant

```
http://doesn'tmatter@www.google.org
http://!$^&*()_+`-={}|[]:;@www.google.com
```

- @ symbol can be represented by its hex code %40 
- dots are %2e



----

## HTTP

The first line of a request is modified to include protocol version information and it's followed by zero or more name:value pairs (headers):
- User-Agent: browser version information
- Host: URL hostanme
- Accept: supported MIME documents( such as text/plain or audio/MPEG)
- Accept-Language: supported language codes
- Referer: originating page for the request
