# Exploits and Attacks Glossary

* Denial of Service (DoS): occurs when an attacker can make a system unavailable by performing some unanticipated action.

* Attack surface: the collection of all entry points that provide access to an asset. Operational vulnerabilities occur when the attack surface is exposed unnecessarily. Minimizing the attack surface is referred to *host hardening*.
